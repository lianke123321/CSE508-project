# CSE508-project
This repository contains my homework of CSE 508 Network Security of 15 Spring, taught by Prof. Michalis Polychronakis at Stony Brook University.
There are four homeworks in total, and in each folder, you could find a hw*.txt file describing the requirement of this homework. You could also find my answer and writeup. My solution might not be optimal. Please only use it as a reference.
